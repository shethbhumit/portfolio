In our SQL project, "Airbnb Reviews Analytics," we embarked on a data-driven journey through the vibrant city of Amsterdam. Recognizing the challenges of web scraping, we harnessed the power of data from ![inside_airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) to gain unique insights into the Airbnb ecosystem.<br>
Our focal point was Amsterdam, a city close to our hearts, and we delved into its rich dataset from a diverse pool of options.<br>

<b>Business Problems Addressed</b><br>

<b>Question 1: Unlocking Airbnb Success Stories</b><br>
As a passionate enthusiast and key business stakeholder, our primary goal was to understand how Airbnb hosts were performing in Amsterdam. We sought answers to the question: "How much are the top Airbnb owners making in Amsterdam?" This insight provides a glimpse into the lucrative world of short-term rentals.<br>

<b>Question 2: Catering to a Niche Market</b><br>
With a long-standing desire to establish an Airbnb Cleaning Business, we embarked on a quest to identify potential customers. By dissecting the data, we aimed to answer the question: "Who comprises the potential customer list for our Airbnb Cleaning Business?" This critical knowledge forms the foundation for our future entrepreneurial endeavors.<br>
Join us as we unveil the intriguing world of Amsterdam's Airbnb landscape, providing data-driven answers to these pressing questions and shedding light on opportunities for entrepreneurial success.
