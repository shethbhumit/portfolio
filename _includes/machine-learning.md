_Key Skills: Classification, Fraud Detection, Random Forest, OneHotEncoder, getdummies, labelencoder_

<div style="text-align: justify">
A large number of problems in data mining are related to fraud detection. Fraud is a common problem in auto insurance claims, health insurance claims, credit card transactions, financial transaction and so on. The data in this particular case comes from an actual auto insurance company. Each record represents an insurance claim. The last column in the table tells you whether the claim was fraudulent or not.<br>
<b>Learnings :</b><br>
<li><b>Dealing with categorical data:</b> OneHotEncoder, getdummies, labelencoder </li>
<li>HyperParameter Tuning using GridSearch and RandomSearch Methods</li>
<li>Building a Random Forest Classifier</li>
<li><b>Model Evaluation :</b> More focus on False Negatives</li>

[![Project Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Read%20Report%20PDF-red?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)]()

_Key Skills: Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression_

<div style="text-align: justify">
From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.<br>

Santander Bank is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.<br>
In this project, we work with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.<br>

You are provided with an anonymized dataset containing a large number of numeric variables. The "TARGET" column is the variable to predict. It equals one for unsatisfied customers and 0 for satisfied customers.<br>
The task is to predict the probability that each customer in the test set is an unsatisfied customer.<br>
We implement a decision tree classifier model from the Scikit-learn library to predict the class. We will initially evaluate the default decision tree model and step by step explore differnent parameters of the decision tree classifier to improve the model.<br>
<b>Learnings:</b> <br>
<li>Building a Classification model using Decision Tree Classfier</li>
<li>Manually tuning ML Models for better accuracy and ROC score</li>  
<li>Model Evaulation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall and ROC curves</li>

[![Project Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Read%20Report%20PDF-red?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)]()

_Key Skills: Classification, Linear SVC, Random Forest, KNN Classifier, MLP Classifier_

<div style="text-align: justify">
This dataset represents the <b>activity of a large number of customers</b> who are interested in buying policies from Homesite. Each QuoteNumber corresponds to a potential customer and the QuoteConversion_Flag indicates whether the customer purchased a policy. <br>
The provided features are anonymized and provide a rich representation of the prospective customer and policy. They include specific coverage information, sales information, personal information, property information, and geographic information. Your task is to predict <b>QuoteConversion_Flag</b> for each QuoteNumber in the test set.
