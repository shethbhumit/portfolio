As the leader of a four-person team for a <b><i>Lean Six Sigma Green Belt</i></b> project at the <b><i>National Industries for the Blind (NIB)</i></b>, we embarked on a mission to investigate growth disparities among <b><i>Nonprofit Agencies (NPAs)</i></b>. Our project involved integrating and analyzing complex datasets, including sales and labor hours, to detect the presence of the Matthew Effect—where larger NPAs potentially outgrow smaller ones.

We developed a <b><i>Composite Score</i></b> to measure NPA performance annually, utilizing statistical tools like <i>Welch t-tests</i> to evaluate growth rate differences. Our findings led to strategic recommendations aimed at promoting equitable growth and enhancing employment opportunities for the blind.

Throughout the project, we collaborated closely with <i>NIB leadership</i>, <i>NPA managers</i>, and <i>advocacy groups</i>, aligning our outcomes with organizational goals. This experience not only influenced policy adjustments within NIB but also significantly enriched our team’s skills in data analysis, strategic planning, and stakeholder engagement. The project was a valuable lesson in the power of data-driven decision-making and its impact on operational and social equity.
