_Key Skills: Python (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Nets, Streamlit), Supply Chain, Data Analysis_

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am led a comprehensive <b>end-to-end project</b> along with 4 graduates, culminating in a Streamlit app to forecast ETA/ETD for ocean shipments, enhancing supply chain visibility.<br>
Key achievements till now:
<li> Analyzed data from 3 customers, covering <b>54k shipments</b> and <b>211 routes</b>.</li>
<li> Enhanced the predictive model with static (e.g., holidays) and dynamic factors (e.g., port congestion, weather disruptions).</li>
<li> Conducted EDA using Tableau, evaluating <b>23 carriers</b> across various routes.</li>
<li> Developed a machine learning model (employing algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLR, and Neural Networks) with an <b>R2 score</b> of <b>0.78</b>, demonstrating high predictive accuracy.</li>
<li> Successfully deployed a Streamlit application showcasing the model's capability to predict shipment times accurately, improving operational efficiency in logistics.</li>

_Key Skills: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)_

<div style="text-align: justify">
This Python project explores sustainability metrics within supply chain data, offering insights into decision-making parameters.<br>
<b>Key Features:</b><br>

<li><b>Delivery Time and Late Delivery Rate:</b> Evaluates average days for shipping, scheduled shipment times, and late delivery rates to assess efficiency and customer satisfaction.</li>

<li><b>Profitability and Efficiency:</b> Measures benefit per order, order profit per order, and order item profit ratio to gauge economic sustainability and profitability.</li>

<li><b>Resource Utilization:</b> Identifies the customer segment generating the most sales and analyzes order item quantities for demand and inventory management.</li>

<li><b>Shipping Modes:</b> Examines the distribution of orders across different shipping modes to identify opportunities for sustainable shipping options.</li>

<li><b>Geographical Analysis:</b> Analyzes markets and regions where orders are delivered, helping optimize distribution and reduce transportation emissions.</li>

<li><b>Order Status Analysis:</b> Measures the distribution of order statuses to identify trends related to order fulfillment and customer satisfaction.</li>
